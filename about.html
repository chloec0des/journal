        <h1>Meet Chloe Toledano</h1>
        <h2>Hey</h2>
        <p>
            I’m so happy you're here. If you don’t know me, my name is Chloe! I'm currently 20 years old, my best friend is a guy named Sacha! I live off ice cream and I never go anywhere without my journal. I also love reading and writing! I feel like that’s all you really need to know... for now. We’ll definitely get to know each other very well. I’m so extremely excited to let you read little pieces of my diary and even more excited to share this journey with you.

            I hope you feel inspired, seen, loved, and most of all not alone in this little journey we call life.

            Oh and just so you know… we’re friends now that you’ve read my (not-so-secret) digital diary. 
        </p>
